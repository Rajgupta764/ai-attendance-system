---

## 🔍 What to Check

### **In the Users Table**
- ✅ Profile image appears as a circular avatar (40x40px)
- ✅ If no image: Shows a user icon placeholder
- ✅ Image is properly cropped and centered

### **In the Browser Console (F12)**
After creating a user, you should see:
```
Created user data: {
  id: "...",
  name: "Test User",
  email: "test@example.com",
  imageUrl: "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  ...
}
```

### **In the Backend Console**
You should see:
```
📤 Uploading image to Cloudinary: filename.jpg
✅ Image uploaded successfully: https://res.cloudinary.com/...
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Image Not Showing After Upload**

**Check 1: Is Cloudinary configured?**
```bash
cd backend
node -e "import('dotenv').then(d => { d.default.config(); console.log('Cloudinary:', process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME); })"
```

**Check 2: Check browser console**
- Press F12
- Look for any errors
- Check the "Created user data" log - does it have an `imageUrl`?

**Check 3: Check backend console**
- Look for "Image uploaded successfully" message
- If you see "Image upload skipped", Cloudinary might not be working

**Check 4: Refresh the page**
- Sometimes the image takes a moment to load from Cloudinary
- Try refreshing the Users page

### **Issue: "Image upload skipped" in Backend**

This means Cloudinary upload failed. Possible causes:
1. **Invalid Cloudinary credentials**
   - Check your `.env` file
   - Verify credentials at https://cloudinary.com/console

2. **Network issue**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Cloudinary might be temporarily down

3. **File too large**
   - Try a smaller image (< 5MB)

### **Issue: Image Shows Broken Icon**

This means the `imageUrl` is invalid or the image was deleted from Cloudinary.

**Solution:**
1. Check the imageUrl in the database
2. Try uploading a new image
3. Verify Cloudinary account is active

## 📝 Technical Details

### **Image Upload Flow**

1. **User selects image** → File stored in `imageFile` state
2. **Preview shown** → Using `URL.createObjectURL()`
3. **Form submitted** → Image added to FormData as `image`
4. **Backend receives** → Multer processes the file
5. **Upload to Cloudinary** → Returns `url` and `publicId`
6. **Save to database** → User record includes `imageUrl`
7. **Return to frontend** → User list refreshed
8. **Display in table** → Image shown from Cloudinary URL

### **Image Transformations**

Cloudinary automatically:
- ✅ Resizes to 500x500px
- ✅ Crops to fill with face detection
- ✅ Optimizes quality
- ✅ Converts to WebP for better performance
